                <p class="card-text">Maybe you've been training your entire life and just want a new exercise to keep things fresh. Or maybe you're getting started with exercise for the first time and don't know how to start working out. Either way, starting a new training routine is something we all deal with from time to time.</p>

You are also learning how to deal with all the changes needed with becoming a new mother. The postpartum period also involves you and your partner learning how to care for your newborn and learning how to function as a changed family unit.</p>

                <p class="card-text">All of us parents feel that we do not have enough time to exercise. Whether we are exhausted taking care of a newborn, chasing after toddlers, doing endless driving and field sidelines for school age kids, a day can end without any exercise in sight. Plus, we feel guilty taking time away from the kids to do a structured workout.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">Getting rid of toxins in the body will give you more energy. So here's another reason to exercise: exercise accelerates the detoxification process. Exercise pushes the blood to circulate more efficiently through the body, allowing nutrients to more easily reach all the organs and muscles. At the same time, exercise helps lymph fluids circulate through the body, which removes toxins and other harmful materials. When you exercise, you naturally take in more oxygen; to make room for the added oxygen, your cells kick out toxins that are taking up space. When you exercise properly, you build up a sweat and toxins are released through the pores of the skin.</p>

Postnatal yoga (or yoga with your baby) serves as an avenue for “getting back in shape,” but also is a compliment to your new life as a mom. You may find that your anxiety is reduced, you’re more centered, and the true harmony of it all — you’re bonding with your child (physically and spiritually).</p>
