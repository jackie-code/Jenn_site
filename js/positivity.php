        <h1>
            The Vision
        </h1>
        <p>
            A brand that will both create an interactive online community as well as provide pregnancy gift kits. Both will be utilized to nurture the intuitive, natural process of motherhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            -The online portion of our brand (including social media) will first start out as a blog, talking all things pregnancy and motherhood. It will be funny, real, and raw, revealing all the “skeletons in the closet” of the journey, and share experiences (including my own) on all-natural motherhood. We can also start to share informational videos and articles on a resources link. Later, we can expand the online site into featuring all kinds of support groups, services, forums, tracking tools, etc. Over time, I would like our website to be a household name for information on healthy pregnancy and motherhood.
        </p>
        <p>
            –The pregnancy kits themselves will be a must have at every baby shower, baby moon, etc. It will be trendy, updated scientifically, aesthetically pleasing, useful, educational, and multi-dimensional. Our goal with these kits is to provide a resource to mothers who want to go through pregnancy naturally, so that they can have a positive pregnancy experience, not one wrought with moodiness, swelling, and pain. They will not have to research online for their nutritional, or physical needs. They will also be given numerous products from companies they can trust, which also saves them time and stress. And on top of it all, it will provide them support and guidance in this vulnerable time of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            -The products: We will include all of our favorite time-appropriate products. They will all be non-toxic, organic, wholesome, useful, natural, and sustainable, with great packaging. Only high integrity* companies will be able to make the cut for our kits. The products will focus mainly on the health of baby and mother, mama beauty care, and positivity. Most of the products will not supply the full length of the trimester, but will initiate an interest towards the brands we feature in our kit while at the same time giving enough to enjoy as a gift. Examples are oils, teas, skincare, lactation cookies, etc. The overall packaging of the kit will also be beautiful in itself, featuring our logo on a nice wooden box.
        </p>
        <p>
            -Then there are the most valuable items of our kit-the book. Encompassing all nutritional basics for the trimester (and recipes!), cover all appropriate exercises and stretches, and go over symptoms you may experience as well as spiritual mindfulness to create a positive journey for mom and baby. Topics covered in these books should answer so many questions, including things like, “what are foods that contain folate?” “why is it important to buy organic during pregnancy?” “what exercises are safe when my stomach is the size of a basketball?” “what nutrient am I lacking if I crave carbs and sugar all day long? What are healthy alternatives?” etc.
