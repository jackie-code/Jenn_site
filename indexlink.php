    <h1>New Mom</h1>
<p>
This is the secret no one tells you when you’re a kid: there’s no magic age when you suddenly become an “adult”, at least not in the ways you think it will happen when you’re a teenager. The reality of being in my mid-twenties is just not anything like what the 13 or 16 year old me thought it would be. I still feel like a stupid teenager sometimes but not nearly as often as I did even 10 years ago. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I think I should be more mature by now. But I think we’re all always still learning and we all have habits or knee-jerk reactions we’d like to change, buttons we’d like to stop letting people push, whatever. To my mind, if you’re mature enough to reliably take care of yourself (emotionally, financially, etc.), know how to solve a problem/handle a crisis/find the help you need, and won’t be resentful of the time and energy and attention a child will need, then you’re certainly “mature” enough to be a mom. Doesn’t mean it’s necessarily the right thing for you right now, but in my mind it means you could do it.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the “quiz” is to ask yourself to imagine your life — right now — with a child in it. Not just the cuddling and rocking and eventual homework, but the logistics of a crying infant at 3am or a sick baby on a work day. Can you envision dealing with that? How much support from family and/or friends do you look for in your life as it is? How might that change with a child and is your network up to the task? What activities or hobbies do you most look forward to now? Would you still be able to do them with a baby? How would you feel if you couldn’t do those things anymore? What would you like to do in the next few years if you don’t have a child? Would you be bummed not to do those things? Why do you want a child now?
</p>
<p>
For me, I’ve been able to picture those changes for decades, but always with a husband. I wasn’t ready to picture doing it on my own until my late 30s and I’m now newly 42 and still trying to get pregnant. I can wish I’d been ready sooner, but I can’t go back and tell my 35 year old self not to wait — I just have to go with where I am. Interestingly, I’m much better able to do that in my 40s than I was in my 30s, so in some ways I’m much more able to deal with the difficulties and set-backs now than I would have been 5 or 6 years ago. Life is funny that way. :?
</p>
<p>
Unless there’s some medical issue that means you need to move fast (assuming you’ll want to get pregnant), you do have some time to keep thinking. I think when the answers to your questions are all (or mostly) coming out with more pros than cons on the side of becoming a mom, then you’ll know you’re as ready as you can be. I hear it’s a wild ride!

    <h1>The Beginnings of Motherhood</h1>
<p>
So you’re pregnant- congrats! Your journey to motherhood has begun! Mixed emotions, fatigue, and food aversions might have already started to take its toll, but now more than ever is a great time to become ever so conscious about your health. Everything you do now and the months to come will play a big part in your baby’s debut, and your first days as a mommy! 
</p>
<p>
If you are reading this, surely you have aspirations to have a pregnancy that is filled more with smiles and glowing skin then swollen ankles and mood swings. It is important to note that despite all your best efforts, sometimes your genetic background will have gifts in store that cannot be avoided. Instead of viewing these symptoms as a result of poor health, take it in stride, and know that your good health will help to manage them from getting any worse, and that it is all apart of the journey towards motherhood. Some women face more perilous roads than others, like experiencing morning (which is more accurately “all-day”) sickness all three trimesters. Yikes. But no matter what Mother Nature has in store for you, stay focused on maintaining good habits, as it will at least help tremendously with the health of your baby and how you recover from childbirth. 
In this post, I will give some advice on exercise, nutrition, skin maintenance, and delivery options so you can experience this time in as much joy and excitement as possible! 
If you’re like me, you have come across genetic goddesses on social media who had somehow managed to maintain a six pack until month five and claimed their baby walked out during delivery. While seeing these posts during the first months, I didn’t understand how women had the energy to get out of the bed, never mind keep up a body building blog. It was a little defeating, because I didn’t know that an energy boost was just a couple weeks away, and the “honeymoon phase” of pregnancy would bring me some of the happiest days of my life. If your starting off slow like me, don’t worry, its completely normal! Hang in there, because the best is yet to come! If you have sickness, here are some things that really helped me:
</p>
<p>
1.)	Eat. Sometimes this did the trick-even if it’s the last thing I wanted to do.<br>
2.)	Keep it Simple. Laying off the cheesy and saucy and sticking with the rice and veggies was a big help.<br>
3.)	CBD oil and ginger has natural anti-nausea properties<br>
4.)	Staying hydrated with warm ginger and peppermint tea was very soothing!<br>
</p>
<p>
Once you start feeling like a functioning human again, the best advice I received was from my mom (who played 8 months pregnant in a co-ed beach v-ball tournament with her first pregnancy-and won! Legend!). She told me to, “pretend like your not pregnant. Keep exercising and doing what you normally do, until you can’t”. Of course if you are in a tackle football league some changes will need to be made immediately. But as far as your level of activity, there is no need to stagnate until things start getting uncomfortable. I was still exercising, playing volleyball and tennis until month 7! And I am glad I did. It only took me 3 weeks after pregnancy to start running and feel like my old self again. Right now, however, is certainly not the time to try to improve fitness, but just maintain it as best you can. If you were an Olympic athlete just before pregnancy, you’ll be doing a lot more than a mom who’s activity consisted of walking fluffy. Either way, keeping doing you mama!
Once your belly gets real big and jogging seems impossible (like it did for me) its time to slow it down and pick some things a little more low-impact. If you are by the beach, walk in the sand and go for a swim! If you have a pool, you know what to do. If you don’t have these options, walking will never be a bad choice-even during labor! Walking for a mile a day is a good goal to shoot for in the final months. 
</p>
<p>
Exercising and eating right does more than just keep you looking right! Increasing your blood flow to you and baby circulates nutrients faster (which means baby gets more!) and keeps your skin elastic! Which is a big deal during pregnancy, for your belly and perineum. 
To keep that beautiful belly stretch mark free, I recommend rubbing one of these three oils before bed every night: Olive, coconut, and avocado oil. Sometimes stretch marks are one of  those inescable gifts, but doing this will really help.

<h1>Parenting Vows</h1>

<p>
    Before our little guy was out in the world, Parker and I would have lots of conversations about the parents we wanted to be. Both of us had things from our childhood we hoped to pass on in River’s life (and things we didn’t.) Disciplinary styles, who’s going be the good-cop/bad-cop, schooling, spiritual upbringing, even eating habits and pets all became apart of the discussion. {INSERT: Can we all please agree to not get our children hamsters? I cannot take another hamster horror story!}  
Having almost a year under my belt now of mothering River, I’ve realized how silly it was to think we would had so much insight on those matters. Eating habits?! Like I knew what I was in for! And discipline? I thought you just had to be firm and loud and consistent when an offense was made…but ohhhhh no. It’s an art-a dance of tango mixed with hopscotch to funky jazz. (if you are thinking, what? Then my point was made) 
</p>
<p>
So, if you are a new mom and are thinking (hopefully not stressing) about the parent you would like to be, know this: You figure it out as it comes. There will be times (many, many times) that you will not have the answers. You will have no clue. And it’s ok. Every mom and dad has been there, and the more I talk with past and present parents, I find that this is really the underlying message to it all. 
</p>
<p>
There were a few ideas, however, that Parker and I had agreed upon that has stayed true throughout the course of parenting thus far, and I think will continue to be relevant in our children’s upbringings. I read an article how mothers in certain villages weave a blanket while good intentions for their child flood their mind. A beautiful prayer-love in every stitch. I cant sew, or crochet, or knit. So we came up with some vows- a creed if you will. They are:
</p>
<p>
#1: We are here to help River accomplish his dreams, not push our dreams for him into his head.<br>
#2: We will expose River to as many creative outlets as possible. Music, art, language, dance…<br>
#3: We will not let our issues negatively affect our home and family life. 
#4: We will expose River to as much nature as possible<br>
</p>
<p>
Obviously we are still early in our journey, but I believe parents of this next generation can help create really independent, confident, children! I love our vows, and we will stick with them as best we can.

<div id="baby">
<h1>Reasons I love being a mom</h1>
<p>
Enjoying the successes
</p>
<p>
The “best part of being a mom is getting to experience on a daily basis all of my kids’ successes. 
</p>
<p>
2Watching them grow
</p>
<p>
3Seeing the wonder
</p>
<p>
“The best part of being a mother, in my opinion, is that with young children every moment is a new adventure. I love seeing their eyes light up with every new discovery. From figuring out how to sound out words, to mastering that addition problem, to just playing house with the dolls from their doll house — everything is done with an innocence and a sense of awe.” — MeGan Galko, mom of kids ranging in ages from three to eight
</p>
<p>
4Learning important lessons
</p>
<p>
“I love how I feel like my son is teaching me to be the best version of myself that I can be. As a mom, I need to be more patient, kinder, gentler, sweeter and more rational than I generally am able to be on my own. He brings out the best in me.” — Emily Guy Birken, mom to a 13 month old
</p>
<p>
5A reminder to stop to smell the roses
</p>
<p>
“Now that I’m a mom, I make time to do the fun things in life like color Easter eggs, go trick-or-treating and bake Christmas cookies. When it was just my husband and me, we would just breeze past holidays and other traditions. Life just feels like it has more substance now,” — Steph Merkle, mom to a one year old
</p>
<p>
6Pure joy!
</p>
<p>
“My number one reason why I love being a mom is the pure joy I get from being a special part of my daughter’s life — watching her learn, smile, giggle, and grow.” — Caren Begun, mom to a three year old
</p>
<p>
7Making the world a better place
</p>
<p>
“I LOVE being a mom because it is the proudest thing I have done — raising another human being to make a difference in this hurting world.” — Linda Van Kessler, mom to a 27 year old
</p>
<p>
8Bravery
</p>
<p>
“It gives me courage to face and conquer my own fears so that I can allow him to see that no matter the difficulty, you can accomplish what you want.” 
</p>
<p>
9Daily inspiration
</p>
<p>
“The thing I love most about my kids is that they are a purer, more innocent version of myself and my husband. In a sense they inspire me to go back to a “me” that wasn’t as hard, distrustful, stressed-out or tired. They motivate me to be a better person in general, as I try each day to be a good mom.” — Linsey Knerl, mom to kids ranging in age from 16 months to 13 years
</p>
<p>
10Special moments
</p>
<p>
“My favorite thing about being a mom is that my daughter can make any moment special. To see her learn, explore, grow, smile, laugh and even cry can make any moment memorable.”

<!-- sunscreen -->
<div id="sunscreen">>
    <h1>Sunscreen and y our Baby</h1>
    <p>
    The general consensus by health professionals is to wait until your baby is 6 months old before using sunscreen. Babies under 6 months have very fragile skin and limiting any sun exposure is best at this age. Young babies also tend to rub their eyes and put their hands in their mouth often. Until babies are 6 months of age they should be kept out of direct sunlight in a heavily shaded area, under an umbrella or under the canopy of a stroller. Always remember to allow for airflow when covering a car seat or stroller as the temperature can rise quickly.
</p>
<p>
Try to limit your baby’s time in the sun between the hours of 11 am and 3 pm as this is when the sun’s rays are the strongest. When enjoying time outside it is important to:
</p>
<p>
Cover as much of your child in clothing that is a tight weave or has a UPF value (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) of 40 or above.<br>
Make sure they are wearing a hat that covers as much of their face, neck, and ears as possible.<br>
Use UV protective sunglasses.<br>
Apply sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or above to all skin not covered by clothing.<br>
Use a chapstick with an SPF of 30 or above.<br>
Apply sunscreen 15-30 minutes prior to sun exposure.<br>
Remember to re-apply sunscreen according to the directions on the bottle or after swimming or heavy perspiration.<br>
You want to avoid sunburns at all costs and if your child us under a year old they should be assessed by a doctor. A sunburn can be a medical emergency for a young baby.<br>
</p>
<p>
CHOOSING THE RIGHT TYPE OF SUNSCREEN
</p>
<p>
Sunscreen is our skin’s last line of defense. Choosing the right sunscreen for your baby can feel overwhelming. The two main types of sunscreen are mineral-based and chemical-based. In recent years there have been some concerns about oxybenzone, avobenzone and retinyl palmitate and their possible link to hormone disruption and skin cancer. The research is somewhat divided. Your best bet is to check the ingredient list and avoid products that contain these ingredients if you are concerned.
</p>
<p>
ALL ABOUT MINERAL SUNSCREEN AND YOUR BABY
</p>
<p>
Mineral sunscreens use zinc oxide and titanium oxide to form a protective barrier from the sun. They tend to be a bit thicker and chalkier but the newer versions have come a long way. Our family has moved to go using mineral sunscreens and have tried out Thinkbaby sunscreen and Saje Sunguard.
</p>
<p>
Thinkbaby is rated an SPF 50+. I love the fruity smell of this sunscreen and it spreads better than most mineral sunscreens we have tried. It is water-resistant for up to 80 minutes requiring less frequent application while playing in the water. It provided exceptional protection for a day spent running in and out of sprinklers and the pool. I also really love Thinkbaby’s body & face sunscreen stick (hyperlink : https://www.amazon.com/thinkbaby-Sunscreen-Stick-White-Orange/dp/B01MSH6605?th=1 ) and always keep one in my diaper bag for impromptu park stops. It is conveniently sized, spreads easily and provides SPF 30 protection.
</p>
<p>
WRAPPING UP
</p>
<p>
I definitely recommend both Saje and thinkbaby sunscreens. When choosing a sunscreen for your baby or child check the ingredients, ensure it has an SPF of 30 or greater, and ensure it is water-resistant if you plan to spend time in the water. Have fun in the sun!

<div id="feeding">
    <h1>Formula vs Breastmilk</h1>
    <p>
By now I’m sure you have been exposed to the many ways breast milk can benefit your little one! Tailor-made for each baby, your body receives feedback on the nutrients your angel needs. There is a communication between the mother and baby without any sound, just another beautiful harmony Mother Nature has created for us. Breast milk is baby’s perfect food. Filled with vitamins, minerals, protein, fat…everything baby needs!  
</p>
<p>
Formula is second-best…though the separation between the two is astonishingly large. I can’t emphasize the importance of breastfeeding enough! Psychologically and physically for Mom and baby there are too many benefits to count! So why doesn’t every one do this?  
</p>
<p>
#1: Work.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this country is not accommodating to the women who works. And now-a-days, you usually need both members of a couple to bring in the dough. So, a typical American mom has to go out for an average shift of 6-8 hours. Without skin-to-skin with baby it is more difficult for some women to produce. And this separation may hault milk production all together. The chore of pumping can be really tough and time consuming as well…sometimes 45min for just a couple ounces! So taking breaks at work can be very difficult depending on the mother’s occupation. Ideally, mom should be able to nurse her baby whenever shed like at home, but sadly this is not the reality so many mothers in our country face.
</p>
<p>
#2: Lack of Milk.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, some women are not able to produce enough milk for their baby. This is a rare occurrence, however. Most moms who dismiss their supply as being, “inadequate”, have not taken any steps towards replenishing their store! Bone broth, specific foods, diet, and so on can really boost your supply! And above all, staying hydrated. If you ever come across a drop in production, don’t fret. That’s natural, and it will take some trial and error to get things right. In the meantime, don’t worry about your little guy. Unless he loses weight, or your doctor advises otherwise, it is just part of the journey!
</p>
<p>
#3: The Pump.
</p>
<p>
Pumping sucks-at least that’s how I felt. It’s like being a dairy cow! You’re hooked up with all these contraptions with the loud noise of the motor beating in your ear. Manually, if you are like me, your hand is likely to cramp before you even get to half an ounce! All that being said, there are still ways to make pumping a little easier. First, manually pump after every feeding to tell your body to boost your supply! Second, pump first thing in morning when your stores are highest! Third, relax while pumping, and make sure you are plenty hydrated throughout the day! 
</p>
<p>
#4: Sore Nips
</p>
<p>
This one is for sure the kicker for so many women. Your nipples aren’t just sore after two weeks of nursing, they are cracked, dry, and sometimes even bleeding. Your baby may have a tongue tie or improper latch, but lets be real-nursing hurts! At least for the first few weeks. It’s an initiation for mom to get through, just like childbirth. Being a mother is no easy feat, but getting through these initial stages of hardship  are crucial to continue breastfeeding! Castor oil, your own milk, and aloe vera were the topicals that helped me through the pain. We have been doing it since the beginning of time-remember that, you CAN do this!
</p>
<p>
There are way more reasons why moms reach for the formula jar, including sleep deprivation and busy schedules. BUT if you fall within the majority of women who can produce nutritious milk for your baby, please do! There is so much support online and around your community! 
</p>

<div id="kauai">
<h1>Lessons Learned From Kauai</h1>
<p>
It has already almost been a year since we moved from beloved Kauai.  Looking back, I remember so many remarkable moments. Most of which were by myself. So much had taken place there on a spiritual level. Looking back, I know God sent me there to learn three valuable lessons: I am not my accomplishments, time is not wasted, and I am in unison with the forces around me.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to write about what I had learned on that magical island because I feel like there might be some value in it to others. Maybe you or someone you know will relate to some of things I have to say this post. If not I hope it will at least make for a good read.
</p>
<p>
To set the stage, before I moved to Kauai my now fiancé and I decided to stop the pursuit of our sports careers and learn more about how to be sustainable human beings. Currently I was playing for the women’s Bundesliga, which is one of the top women’s soccer leagues in the world. While there, it was a passion of ours to learn about all the ways people could change their lifestyles to make positive impact on the Earth and each other. We even started a website titled, “Know and Grow”, which was intended to serve as a social media platform for impactful companies and farmers to connect and offer services with one another. Upon a dream and a few other stars aligning, we had found our vision becoming realized when Sonja, a charismatic German hippie, invited us to stay on her and her husband’s beautiful organic farm in Kauai for trade of work. 
Listening to our intuition, we set out on the journey, giving away just about everything we had. Parker no longer was going back to Connecticut to continue his pitching, and I ended my contract a year early. With a couple of backpacks and our ukulele, we headed for Kauai. 
</p>
<p>
Little did I know how deeply my identity was rooted in being an athlete. Once we stopped working on the farm and assimilated into normal life on the island, we obviously had to get real jobs-something I have never done before. My whole life I looked at working 9-5 jobs like something for the mediocre, less fortunate gene pools. I always had some sort of scholarship to support my needs. If I sound like a snob, it’s because I was, even though I never really knew it. So completing rudimentary tasks on the same redundant checklist at my new jobs day in and day out was defeating. My occupation used to be competing, bettering myself, pushing my limits, and now it was cutting vegetables and mopping kitchen floors. Though I clearly didn’t know it at the time, I was learning many useful skills in what is now a full-blown culinary passion. But my attitude had plunged me into regret and despair. Our Know and Grow idea was never worked on, because I didn’t know where or how to start in this brand new place. I had such vast aspirations to become a self-made business overnight after I ended my soccer career, but realized I had no clue what I was getting into. I felt that because I was so successful in sports, it must translate over to other areas. Wrong! On top of that I was losing fitness by the hour, and my previous goals to be the best women’s soccer player in the U.S. was falling further and further out of reach to go back to. I was panicked, doubtful, and shocked. 
</p>
<p>
What made it all the worse was that I no longer received the same attention that I used to. Throughout my life I was told that I was “so talented”, “so elite”, “so skilled”. And as a professional, children asking for your autograph after matches and having fans hold up your poster didn’t help my ever expanding ego.  
With such an unforeseen and sudden change in lifestyle, my identity went through a crisis. Who was I without my athleticism? What was I without my thing that made me special? Does this now mean I’m average? 
</p>
