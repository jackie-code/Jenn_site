        If you're a big fan of sassy Kung Pao Chicken, this vegetarian version is definitely worth a try for your next weeknight dinner. We parboil the potatoes for a creamier consistency, then finish the cooking in a spicy, salty sauce for maximum flavor pay-off. Throw in some chopped red onions, bell peppers, and crunchy peanuts, and it's a vegetarian delight that's sure to please even the pickiest meat lovers in your life. (For the omnivores and flexitarians out there, we've also given the option of using chicken broth instead of vegetable broth for an added layer of savoriness in the dish.)

    There’s nothing like the magic of a quick noodle fix coupled with the nostalgia of Cup-o-Noodle. Lotus Foods has allowed me to enjoy this all over again. Whereas 5 years ago I’d have to stock pile pad thai flat rice noodles for curries and stir-fries alike, now I always have one of Lotus’ whole grain ramen varieties on hand.

    This Creamy Cashew Tofu Alfredo must be on your dinner menu. When combined with cashews, garlic, non-dairy milk, and salt, tofu can be turned into a creamy alfredo sauce that’s perfect for pasta. Unlike firmer tofu, silken tofu blends up very well without a grainy texture. That means this sauce is silky and delicious as the dairy version. Win!

    <p class="card-text">I should probably think twice before I toss around words like “ultimate”—there are a lot of raw mushroom burgers out there, and this is but one of them. With that said, it’s probably my favorite raw burger so far, and I’ve got a bunch that I love: most recently, I posted a raw spinach burger that was pretty delicious. What I like about this burger is its “meatier” texture (most of my burgers are a little crumbly) and the earthy taste that comes from mushrooms and seasonings.</p>
