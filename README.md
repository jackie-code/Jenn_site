# Website made for my sister

This was a final project I did for the code school I went to. We had the option of making a website of any topic we liked. I chose to make one for my sister. She's a new mom and eventually wants to promote herself online so she can sell some items. This site is still being worked on and will eventually have a large shopping area for makeup, clothes, toys, and other accessories. I'm still working on it and getting new ideas all the time. It was fun to make because of her beach-girl style and adding all the colors and images I liked.
